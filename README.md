Real Time Face Mask Detection Using OpenCV Python

In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
declared the use of a face mask as a mandatory biosafety measure. This has 
caused problems in current facial recognition systems, motivating the development 
of this research. This manuscript describes the development of a system for
recognizing people, even when they are using a face mask, from photographs. A 
classification model based on the MobileNetV2 architecture and
the OpenCv’s face detector is used. Thus, using these stages, it can be identified 
where the face is and it can be determined whether or not it is wearing a face 
mask. The FaceNet model is used as a feature extractor and a feedforward 
multilayer perceptron to perform facial recognition. For training the facial 
recognition models, a set of observations made up of 13,359 images is generated;
52.9% images with a face mask and 47.1% images without a face mask. The 
experimental results show that there is an accuracy of 99.65% in determining 
whether a person is wearing a mask or not. An accuracy of 99.52% is achieved in 
the facial recognition of 10 people with masks, while for facial recognition without 
masks, an accuracy of 99.96% is obtained.
During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect 
against this deadly virus. In this project we will develop a machine learning project –
Real-time Face Mask Detector with Python.
We will build a real-time system to detect whether the person on the webcam is 
wearing a mask or not. We will train the face mask detector model using Keras and
OpenCV.
Face recognition is a natural method of recognizing and authenticating people. Face 
recognition is an integral part of people's everyday contact and lives. The most 
effective approach for detecting a person's face is to use Python and a Convolutional
Neural Network in deep learning. This method is useful in a variety of fields, including 
the military, defense, schools, colleges, and universities, airlines, banks, online web 
apps, gaming, and so on.
Face masks are now widely used as part of standard virus- prevention measures, 
especially during the Covid-19 virus outbreak. Many individuals or organizations must 
be able to distinguish whether or not people are wearing face masks in a given 
location or time. This data's requirements should be very real-time and automated. 
The challenging issue which can be mentioned in face detection is inherent diversity
in faces such as shape, texture, color, got a beard\moustache and/or glasses and 
even masks.
From the experiments it is clear that the proposed CNN and Python algorithm is very 
efficient and accurate in determining the facial recognition and detection of 
individuals.
